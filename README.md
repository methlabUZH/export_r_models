# R script for exporting lm() or lmer() models to a nice table in word

`export_model_table.R` works for all models, but the variable names in the exported Word document are in raw form (e.g., Gender1) and are not sorted. The second script, `export_model_table_labels.R`, shows how to adapt the script to relabel and sort all model terms more clearly.
 
An example Word document with the formatted table is also attached.
 
No more typing all the numbers by hand! : )
